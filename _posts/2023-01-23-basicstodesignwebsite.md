# Summary

When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side. Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is what you want to accomplish. Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from a lack of technical know-how, but from lack of goals and vision.

So when you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:

-  What exactly do I want to accomplish?
- How will a website help me reach my goals?
- What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

All of this is called project ideation and is a necessary first step to reach your goal, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.
